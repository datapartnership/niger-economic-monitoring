# Niger Economic Monitoring

## Assignment

The West Africa Prosperity Team has requested support for using alternative data to better understand economic trends in Niger following a coup and civil unrest. 

The assignment covers analysis of crop productivity trends, conflict mapping, monitoring nighttime lights, and understanding population movement trends. 


## Data

The following datasets are used in this assignmet. Further details about each dataset -- licensing, frequency of updates, access instructions, etc. -- accompany each data product in which they were used (see below).

* [ACLED](https://worldbank.github.io/iraq-economic-monitoring/docs/2-data.html#(https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/search/dataset/0061835/acled---middle-east)) - Time-stamped, geolocated points where conflicts (protests, attacks, etc.) have occured, collected globally based on news and crowdsourced data.

* [BlackMarble](http://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/) - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Lights from NASA.

* [Digital Earth Africa Cropland Extent Map](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/platform-resources/services/cropland-extent-map) - The service shows the presence or absence of crop for a 10-meter pixel resolution.

* [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) - NASA's 'Modern Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer' dataset, used to monitor changes in surface vegetation. 

* [Meta Co-Loctiaon Maps](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/colocation-maps) - Colocation Maps measure the probability that two individuals from two locations are found in the same location at the same time. These maps help researchers analyze the probability that people in areas with disease outbreaks will come in contact with new populations. The data can be requested through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/).
